# Mecha-cms-Arbitrary-File-Deletion-Vulnerability
The **Arbitrary File Deletion Vulnerability** was found in file: **`./lot/x/panel/index/panel/type/page/page.php::13`** , this file can be required by another file, thus bypassing the CMS check on the legitimacy of the user's identity, the parameter **`$x`** is not reasonably filtered, leading to the vulnerability.

## Information

**Code from:** [https://github.com/mecha-cms/mecha/archive/refs/tags/v3.0.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/mecha-cms/mecha/archive/refs/tags/v3.0.0.tar.gz) → mecha-3.0.0.tar.gz

**Version:** mechaCMS 3.0.0

**Summarize:** Attackers can construct elaborate cookies that bypass mecha CMS’s checks for the existence of a user's identity, attackers can also construct elaborate URIs that bypass mecha CMS’s checks for the legitimacy of a user's identity. Eventually, parameters are passed through the POST method, resulting in the deletion of arbitrary files.

## Steps

Construct the HTTP request and the parameters as follows. Among them, the **Path parameter** of the request line, the **POST request body parameter**, and the **cookies** are elaborated.

In **`./lot/x/user/engine/plug/hook.php`** , there is a check for the existence of user:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9ed8180-5918-4c96-913f-b7027c4e88f9)

To reverse the execution logic of the **`cookie('user.name')`** function, you can manually set the cookie so that this function returns a specified path:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a27e2c05-a413-448c-9382-a709788bd8c5)

When **`Ii4uL3kvbG9nL2Fib3V0Ig==`** is set as a cookie value, the resulting path is **`"../y/log/about"`**: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10e9a866-8fef-42d6-a4c7-6157ee6b8acb)

Because **`/var/www/html/mecha/lot/user/../y/log/about.page`** is a legal file:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/088b5508-1c15-49e1-aed4-470f40e11bac)

When the code executes to **`./lot/x/panel/index.php`** , **`$user->exist`** is not empty, it will be the path specified in the above step.

Even though it's not the user's **.page** file, we can still go to panel.php.

By triggering the Hook, we can access the **`route.php`** file:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b24cdd8a-bf2e-4678-b994-56dd8ed44309)

The `*'path'*` in **`$_`** does the string splicing in the loop and passes in the variable **`$f`**, which is required once per loop, so **`./lot/x/panel/index/panel/route/../type/page/page.php`** file is successfully required.

mechaCMS does employ some measures to prevent directory traversal, but this can still be bypassed:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2625d96-b815-434f-af93-894d5f52d73b)

Just use ‘….//’ in **`'path'`** which becomes to '../’ after being filtered. 

Ultimately, in **`page.php`**, when the POST parameter is as shown, the unlink function removes any file specified in **`$_POST['page']['x']`**

I deleted **`del.abc`** from a web root directory to test the effectiveness of the exploit:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dbd0336-8a77-443d-bba9-fedd0d051ad6)

Deleted successfully.

Once the username of mechaCMS is known (**admin** is used as an example in the picture below), anyone can take over mechaCMS by deleting the user's authentication file, which is horrible!
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57af33b9-daef-4134-88e1-38c6bb78f1a5)

Just like this, **`pass.data`** is also deleted.
